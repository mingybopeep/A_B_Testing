    "## A/B Testing with Cookie Cats Dataset\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Cookie Cats is an online mobile game. The dev team have decided that they want to see how changing a feature will affect their players. The feature being changed is the in-game level at which the player meets a gate. They want to understand the effects of a player encountering the gate later in the game (level 40) compared to earlier (level 30). The purpose of this analysis is to investigate whether there is a statistically significant effect of gate placement on player retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In order to make it clear what the data is showing, a description of each field / column has been added: \n",
    "- userid: The UUID of a given player. \n",
    "- version: This field refers to the A/B group, and contains either 'gate_30' or 'gate_40' as a value, the number referring to the level. \n",
    "- sum_gamerounds: This is the total number of rounds of Cookie Cats completed by a player during the first 14 days after install. \n",
    "- retention_1: Boolean value whether or not a player came back to play 1 day after installing. \n",
    "- retention_7: Boolean value whether or not a player came back to play 7 days after installing. \n",
    "\n",
    "**What relationships can be explored in this data to answer the problem statement? **\n",
    "1. Effect of 'version' on 'sum_gamerounds'. \n",
    "2. Effect of 'version' on 'retention_1'. \n",
    "3. Effect of 'version' on 'retention_7'. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypotheses \n",
    "Measuring the effect of version on sum_gamerounds: \n",
    "- H0: Gate placement at level 40 does not have an effect on the number of rounds completed by a user vs placement at level 30. \n",
